# embedded-journey
My step-by-step embedded systems learning journey (2025–onwards)

This is my 2-year deep dive into Embedded Systems and Systems Programming. This repo documents everything I learn- from C, LINUX, RTOS, and MCU projects to debugging techniques and HW-SW integration.

---

## Current Focus (June 2025)
- Brushing up on C (pointers, memory models, linker scripts)
- Linux fundamentals (file system, bash, permissions, process management)
- Working through Embedded Systems course on edX
- Building a GitHub profile from scratch

---

## Repo Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `c-learning` | C programs with comments, experiments with memory, pointers, bitwise ops |
| `linux-basics` | Shell scripts, Linux internals, command cheatsheets |
| `embedded-projects` | Microcontroller projects, schematics, code, photos/videos |
| `edx-notes` | Course notes + implementation of concepts from [edX Embedded Course](https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-the-world) |

## Current Focus (July 2025)

- Learning Linux fundamentals — completed 9 lessons from **LFS101x: Introduction to Linux**
- Exploring Operating Systems via **NPTEL course** and curated YouTube resources
- Working through **"Learn Memory Management in C"** by Boot.dev to understand heap, stack, and malloc
- Setting up my GitHub and documenting every meaningful step
- Beginning to structure this repo into concept folders and micro-projects

---

## Goals for August 2025

- Complete LFS101x course and revise notes
- Finish Boot.dev memory management track
- Document my OS learning
