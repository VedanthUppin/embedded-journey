# embedded-journey
My step-by-step embedded systems learning journey (2025–onwards)

This is my 2-year deep dive into Embedded Systems and Systems Programming. This repo documents everything I learn- from C, LINUX, RTOS, and MCU projects to debugging techniques and HW-SW integration.

## 🛠️ Current Focus (June 2025)
- Brushing up on C (pointers, memory models, linker scripts)
- Linux fundamentals (file system, bash, permissions, process management)
- Working through Embedded Systems course on edX
- Building a GitHub profile from scratch
